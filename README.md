##**OCC - Child Reports**
If there are something that can't be used in the ExecEye Platform you can replace it with another supported way. 

**EXAMPLE:** For the Pop up in the ByModel view I used the bootstrap pop up but you can repleace it with any pop up supported.

##**HTML & CSS**

In the **Assets** folder are all the images, CSS & JS files.

In the **Views** folder are the HTML files of the child reports views.
